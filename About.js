        <h2>It Started as an Anonymous Good Deed</h2>
          <p>What began as a concerned family's effort to remember adults with special needs during the holiday season has become 
          Angels Bearing Gifts, a small, well-regarded Santa Barbara organization with a mission unique among non-profits in the United States.</p>
          <p>In 1999, Evelynn Smith and her daughter, Michelle, a person with developmental disabilities, delivered holiday gifts to nine people with developmental disabilities. 
            Unlike Michelle, they had no families. They had no one to remember them at a time when being alone can feel most painful.</p>
          <p>Today, the organization serves more than 200 people with developmental disabilities who have outlived their families or whose families have withdrawn from their lives have Angels
            to remember them on their birthdays, Valentine’s Day, and the December holidays. Beneficiaries may live in group homes, skilled nursing facilities, or in their own apartments with live-in or shift care providers.
            They have diagnoses that range from Down Syndrome or other chromosomal/ genetic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, fetal alcoholism spectrum disorder, and mental retardation.
            Clients' ethnic diversity is reflective of Santa Barbara County in general.</p>
          <p>Angels Bearing Gifts operates out of donated offices with two volunteers that serve as part-time unpaid staff.
          As hard as they work, they are the first to declare that without passionate and dependable volunteers Angels don’t fly.
          And without the financial support of a generous, compassionate community Angels don’t even have wings.</p>
          <p>In addition to fulfilling the mission of remembering those with developmental disabilities on birthdays and holidays, Angels Bearing Gifts strives to “foster compassion within our community…via year-round volunteer and educational outreach activities.” 
            Angels provides a speaker for the County Schools Philanthropy Curriculum taught in third grade classes. A dynamic young woman with Down Syndrome travels to classrooms around the County with the Angels Volunteer Coordinator, telling rapt students about her struggles and successes of her own school days all the way to graduation at Santa Barbara High School.</p>
          <p>Angels Bearing Gifts is also a popular choice for students seeking community service hours especially during the holiday season when they can join other volunteers shopping, wrapping, and delivering gifts or sewing stockings or decorating gift bags.
            Students have also helped collect stocking stuffer items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and body wash, socks, flashlights, and quarters for laundry machines.</p>
          <p>You can sponsor a beneficiary! You, too, can be an Angel.</p>

          <p>A gift is --</p>
            <ul>
              <li>an expression of caring</li>
              <li>a gesture of remembrance</li>
              <li>a connection to tradition</li>
              <li>an embrace</li>
              <li>a smile</li>
              <li>a sigh</li>
            </ul>
        <p>And some laughs, if you’re lucky. But above all a gift says this: "You’re special".</p>
